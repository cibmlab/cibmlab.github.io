  description: Consistent identification of neurons in different experimental modalities is a key problem in neuroscience. Here, we present an efficient optimization framework to learn coordinated representations of multimodal data, and apply it to a large multimodal dataset profiling mouse cortical interneurons. Code for the Gala et al, NeurIPS, 2019 paper.
